# Features

### Each page contains a head section, which includes an image with the business name and a nav menu that directs you to the three main pages. Also a footer where can be found the media links to Facebook and Instagram, also a help button that directs you to a new page with some FAQS. In each page, can be found a floating button that takes you to the heading section. It's located in the bottom right area and has an opacity attribute so it does not cover the page information.<br>
