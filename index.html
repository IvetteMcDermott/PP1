        <p id="intro1">Itza's Bakeshop is a vision of a young entrepreneur, my self, Itza. Since little, I remember my mother baking, 
            the smell in the house was a signal of spending time together around the table with a nice glass of milk and some bake good 
            just fresh made by her. It is like this that my memories around the baking start. <br>
            <br> 
            As I started to grow older she started to included me more and more in the process, giving me little tasks as to sift the flour, and with the time I finally baked my own 
            cake when I was about 6 and since then had not stopped! Making to share with family and friends at the start, and with the pass 
            of years, I finally took some courses that helped me to wide my knowledge, learning about new materials and techniques to use
            in what was my hobby, that become passion for now finally get the shape of my own business! <br>
        </p>

            So now, I can not just offer the traditional baking that was pass to me by my mother, and to her from hers, but also can keep 
            and produce accorder to the new tendencies, but with the quality and love to the good baking that always have.
            Run since my kitchen in a small house in the heart of a traditional neighbourhood in Jesus Maria, every product is make fresh, 
            caring to use good quality ingredients as I would do for my home. <br>
            The satisfaction of my clients is the most important to me.
            Get a comment on how much they enjoyed it or that kids love it, it is the best reward to my work.
