        <p id="intro1">Itza's Bakeshop is a vision of a young entrepreneur, myself, Itza. Since I was little, I remember my mother baking,  
                       the smell in the house was a signal of spending time together around the table with a nice glass of milk and some 
                       baked goods just freshly made by her. It is from times like this that my memories around the baking start.   <br>
            <br> 
                        As I started to grow older she started to include me more and more in the process, giving me little tasks, such as to 
                        sift the flour, and with time I finally baked my own cake when I was about 6 and since then, have not stopped!
                        Making to share with family and friends at the start, and with the passing of years, I finally took some courses that 
                        helped me to widen my knowledge, learning about new materials and techniques to use in what was my hobby, that become 
                        a passion, and now finally getting the shape of my own business!  <br>
        </p>

                So now, I cannot just offer the traditional baking that was passed to me by my mother, and to her from hers, but I can also 
                keep up with and produce according to the new tendencies, but with the quality and love to the good baking that always had 
                come from my kitchen in a small house in the heart of a traditional neighborhood in Jesus Maria, every product is made 
                fresh, taking care to use good quality ingredients as I would do for my home. The satisfaction of my clients is the most important 
                to me. <br> 
                Getting a comment on how much they enjoyed it or that kids love it. It is the best reward for my work.
